# Tasks: WellKorea Integrated Work System (ERP)

**Feature**: 001-erp-core
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-erp-core/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, data-model.md, contracts/openapi.yaml, research.md, quickstart.md

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

**✅ Constitution Compliance Update (2025-12-02)**: Test-first discipline explicitly enforced - 46 test tasks added across all 9 user stories, each marked "Write FIRST - MUST FAIL initially" per Constitution Principle I (Test-First Development). Tests now precede all implementation code.

**✅ Architecture Consistency Update (2025-12-03)**: All repository task descriptions updated to use `/infrastructure/persistence/` path (14 tasks across US1-US9) to align with domain-oriented architecture defined in plan.md. Fixes finding D1 from speckit.analyze.

**✅ Requirement Coverage Update (2025-12-03)**: Added 3 tasks (T078a, T078b, T093a) for FR-018c quotation revision notification feature. Admin can now choose to email customers when quotation is revised. Fixes finding R1 from speckit.analyze.

**✅ Final Pre-Implementation Fixes (2025-12-03)**: Added 3 tasks (T048a, T048b, T097a) for FR-062 Sales role customer assignment + updated T147 to explicitly include delivery_id foreign key per FR-035. Role verification moved to API layer (QuotationController) per architectural principle. All analysis findings (R1, R2, I1, U1) now resolved. Ready for implementation.

**✅ Multi-Level Approval Update (2025-12-19)**: Updated approval domain (US2) to support multi-level sequential approval (결재 라인). Added 14 tasks for ApprovalChainTemplate, ApprovalChainLevel, ApprovalLevelDecision entities and Admin configuration endpoints. Approval now proceeds through ordered levels (팀장 → 부서장 → 사장) with position-based approvers (specific users, not roles).

**✅ CQRS Pattern Implementation (2025-12-20)**: Applied Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern to Quotation and Approval domains. Command endpoints (create, update, submit, approve, reject) now return minimal `CommandResult { id, message }` instead of full entities. Query endpoints return full entities. Updated OpenAPI specification (v1.1.0), research.md, and frontend services/hooks. All backend and frontend tests pass. See research.md for detailed architectural decision.

**✅ Company Unification & Purchasing Redesign (2025-12-23)**: Merged Customer and Supplier into unified `Company` entity with `CompanyRole` (CUSTOMER, VENDOR, OUTSOURCE) for dual-role support. Added `ServiceCategory` and `VendorServiceOffering` for "select service → get vendor/price list" functionality (FR-053). Replaced RFQ with `PurchaseRequest` + `RFQItem` workflow. Updated all FK references (customer_id → customer_company_id, supplier_id → vendor_company_id).

**✅ FSD-Lite Architecture Migration (2025-12-30 / 2026-01-05)**: Frontend migrated to Feature-Sliced Design (FSD-Lite) aligned with backend DDD + CQRS patterns. Added Phase 0 for TanStack Query infrastructure setup. Updated all frontend task paths to use FSD layers: `entities/`, `features/`, `widgets/`, `pages/`, `shared/`, `stores/`. See [docs/architecture/fsd-public-api-guidelines.md](../../docs/architecture/fsd-public-api-guidelines.md) for Query Factory and Command Function patterns.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **US9 - RBAC (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational - Security foundation for P1
- **US1 - JobCode (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational and US9 - Core MVP data entry
- **Company Domain (Phase 4a)**: Depends on Foundational - Unified Customer/Vendor entity **← NEW 2025-12-23**
- **US2 - Quotation (Phase 5)**: Depends on US1, Company Domain, and US9 - Commercial documents require projects, companies, and security
- **US3 - Product Catalog (Phase 6)**: Depends on Foundational - Can run in parallel with US1/US2
- **US4 - Production (Phase 7)**: Depends on US1 (requires projects) - Can run in parallel with US2/US3
- **US5 - Delivery (Phase 8)**: Depends on US2 (requires quotations) - Sequential after US2
- **US6 - Invoicing (Phase 9)**: Depends on US5 (requires deliveries) - Sequential after US5
- **US7 - Documents (Phase 10)**: Depends on Foundational - Can run in parallel with any user story
- **US8 - Purchasing (Phase 11)**: Depends on US1 and Company Domain (requires projects and unified Company/vendor) **← UPDATED 2025-12-23**
- **Polish (Phase 12)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **US9 (RBAC)**: Foundation for security - must complete before quotations/invoices
- **US1 (JobCode)**: Foundation for all work - most other stories depend on this
- **Company Domain**: Foundation for Customer/Vendor - US2 and US8 depend on this **← NEW 2025-12-23**
- **US2 (Quotation)**: Depends on US1 and Company Domain (requires projects and companies)
- **US3 (Product Catalog)**: Independent - can run in parallel
- **US4 (Production)**: Depends on US1 - can run in parallel with US2
- **US5 (Delivery)**: Depends on US2 - sequential after quotations
- **US6 (Invoicing)**: Depends on US5 - sequential after deliveries
- **US7 (Documents)**: Independent - can run in parallel with any story
- **US8 (Purchasing)**: Depends on US1 and Company Domain (requires projects and vendors) **← UPDATED 2025-12-23**

### Critical Path for MVP (P1 Stories Only)

1. Phase 1: Setup → Phase 2: Foundational
2. Phase 3: US9 (RBAC) - Security foundation
3. Phase 4: US1 (JobCode) - Core data entry
4. Phase 4a: Company Domain - Unified Customer/Vendor **← NEW 2025-12-23**
5. Phase 5: US2 (Quotation) - Commercial documents
6. **MVP DELIVERED** - Can stop here for initial launch

### Parallel Opportunities

#### After Foundational Phase Completes:

- US9 (RBAC), US3 (Products), US7 (Documents), Company Domain can all run in parallel
- Once US1 (JobCode) and Company Domain complete: US4 (Production), US8 (Purchasing) can run in parallel
- Once US2 (Quotation) completes: US5 (Delivery) starts
- Once US5 (Delivery) completes: US6 (Invoicing) starts

#### Within Each User Story:

- Tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (different files)
- Database migrations (T0XX) → Entities (T0XX [P]) → Repositories → Services → Controllers
- Frontend components can run in parallel with backend if API contracts are defined first

---

## Parallel Example: Foundational Phase

```bash
# After Setup (Phase 1) completes, run these in parallel:
Task T017: GlobalExceptionHandler (shared/exception/)
Task T018: AuditLogger (shared/audit/)
Task T019: MinioFileStorage (document/service/)
Task T020: SecurityConfig (security/config/)
Task T021: UserDetailsService (security/service/)
Task T022: RBAC implementation (security/domain/)
Task T023: application.properties configuration
Task T024: JobCodeGenerator (project/domain/)
Task T025: AuthContext (frontend/contexts/)
Task T026: API client (frontend/services/)
Task T027: ProtectedRoute (frontend/components/)
Task T028: ErrorBoundary (frontend/components/)
Task T029: React Router setup (frontend/App.tsx)
Task T030: UI component library (frontend/components/ui/)
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (JobCode)

```bash
# After database migration V6 completes, run entities in parallel:
Task T050: Project entity
Task T051: ProjectStatus enum
Task T052: Customer entity

# After entities complete, implement services sequentially:
Task T053: ProjectRepository
Task T054: ProjectService
Task T055: JobCodeGenerator
Task T056: ProjectController

# Frontend can run in parallel with backend once API contract is defined:
Task T060: ProjectService API client
Task T061: ProjectListPage
Task T062: CreateProjectPage
Task T063: EditProjectPage
Task T064: ProjectDetailPage
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (P1 Stories: US9 + US1 + Company Domain + US2)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: US9 (RBAC security foundation)
4. Complete Phase 4: US1 (JobCode creation)
5. Complete Phase 4a: Company Domain (Unified Customer/Vendor) **← NEW 2025-12-23**
6. Complete Phase 5: US2 (Quotation + Approval)
7. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test MVP independently
8. Deploy/demo if ready

**Estimated MVP Scope**: ~116 tasks (T001-T097 + Company Domain T052a-T052s) - delivers core job intake, unified company management, quotation workflow, and security

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Foundation**: Setup + Foundational → Infrastructure ready (~31 tasks)
2. **Security MVP**: + US9 → RBAC complete (~17 tasks)
3. **Data Entry MVP**: + US1 → JobCode creation complete (~17 tasks)
4. **Company Domain**: + Company → Unified Customer/Vendor complete (~19 tasks) **← NEW 2025-12-23**
5. **Commercial MVP**: + US2 → Quotation workflow complete (~30 tasks) 🎯 **LAUNCH HERE**
6. **Product Catalog**: + US3 → Product standardization (~15 tasks)
7. **Production Tracking**: + US4 → Work progress visible (~16 tasks)
8. **Delivery**: + US5 → Delivery tracking complete (~16 tasks)
9. **Financial**: + US6 → AR/AP tracking complete (~25 tasks)
10. **Documents**: + US7 → Document management complete (~16 tasks)
11. **Purchasing**: + US8 → Vendor service management complete (~46 tasks) **← UPDATED 2025-12-23**
12. **Polish**: Final validation and deployment (~23 tasks)

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 3 developers after Foundational phase completes:

- **Developer A**: US9 (RBAC) → US1 (JobCode) → US4 (Production)
- **Developer B**: US3 (Products) → US2 (Quotation) → US5 (Delivery) → US6 (Invoicing)
- **Developer C**: US7 (Documents) → US8 (Purchasing) → Polish

Stories integrate at natural boundaries (e.g., quotations use products from catalog, deliveries reference quotations).

## Summary

**Total Tasks**: ~380 tasks (305 implementation + 65 test-first tasks + 10 new FSD-Lite sub-tasks)
**MVP Tasks (P1)**: ~175 tasks (Phase 0 FSD-Lite + Setup + Foundational + US9 + US1 + Company Domain + US2 including test-first tasks + multi-level approval + FR-062 customer assignment)
**P2 Tasks**: ~120 tasks (US3 + US4 + US5 + US6 including test-first tasks, updated for FSD-Lite)
**P3 Tasks**: ~62 tasks (US7 + US8 including test-first tasks, updated for FSD-Lite)
**Polish Tasks**: ~23 tasks (Phase 12)

**Constitution Compliance**: ✅ **Test-First Development enforced** - 65 test tasks explicitly marked "Write FIRST - MUST FAIL initially" across all 9 user stories + Company domain

**FSD-Lite Architecture Update (2025-12-30)**: All frontend tasks updated to use FSD-Lite structure:
- `entities/` - Domain models with types, rules, queries, and display UI
- `features/` - Isolated user actions/workflows (one feature = one action)
- `widgets/` - Composite panels combining multiple features
- `pages/` - Route-level assembly components (no business logic)
- `shared/` - Cross-cutting concerns (api, ui, lib, types)

**Task Distribution by User Story** (including test-first tasks):
- **Phase 0 - FSD-Lite Migration**: 11 tasks **← NEW 2025-12-30**
- Setup (Phase 1): 12 tasks
- Foundational (Phase 2): 19 tasks (updated for FSD-Lite paths)

- US5 - Delivery (Phase 8): 22 tasks (4 tests + 18 implementation, updated for FSD-Lite) **← UPDATED 2025-12-30**
- US6 - Invoicing (Phase 9): 35 tasks (5 tests + 30 implementation, updated for FSD-Lite) **← UPDATED 2025-12-30**
- US7 - Documents (Phase 10): 20 tasks (4 tests + 16 implementation, updated for FSD-Lite) **← UPDATED 2025-12-30**
- US8 - Purchasing (Phase 11): 55 tasks (8 tests + 47 implementation, updated for FSD-Lite) **← UPDATED 2025-12-30**
- Polish (Phase 12): 23 tasks (validation & deployment)

**Company Unification & Purchasing Redesign (2025-12-23 Update)**:
- Added 19 new tasks for Company domain (Phase 4a):
  - 4 new test tasks (T052a, T052b, T052c, T052d)
  - 1 migration task (T052e)
  - 9 backend tasks (T052f-T052n)
  - 5 frontend tasks (T052o-T052s)
- Unified `Company` entity with `CompanyRole` (CUSTOMER, VENDOR, OUTSOURCE) for dual-role support
- Updated US8 Purchasing domain (+22 tasks) with new entities:
  - `ServiceCategory`: Service types (CNC, etching, painting)
  - `VendorServiceOffering`: Vendor-specific service pricing
  - `PurchaseRequest` + `RFQItem`: Replaces old RFQ structure
  - Updated FK references (customer_id → customer_company_id, supplier_id → vendor_company_id)

**Multi-Level Approval (2025-12-19 Update)**:
- Added 14 new tasks for multi-level sequential approval (결재 라인):
  - 4 new test tasks (T070a, T071a, T074a, T075a)
  - 7 new entity tasks (T079, T079a, T081, T081a, T082, T082a + updated)
  - 4 new repository tasks (T083, T083a, T083b, T083c)
  - 4 new service/controller tasks (T084, T084a, T084b, T084c, T085, T085a)
  - 3 new frontend tasks (T095a, T095b, T095c)
- Approval chain configurable by Admin per entity type (QUOTATION, PURCHASE_ORDER)
- Sequential levels: Level 1 (팀장) → Level 2 (부서장) → Level 3 (사장)
- Position-based approvers (specific users, not RBAC roles)

**Test-First Discipline**:
- Each user story phase NOW includes explicit "Tests for User Story X (Write FIRST)" section
- All test tasks marked with "⚠️ Constitution Requirement: MUST be written FIRST and MUST FAIL before implementation begins"
- Test tasks include contract tests, unit tests, and integration tests BEFORE any implementation code
- This ensures full compliance with Constitution Principle I (Test-First Development)

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- Within Setup: 9 tasks marked [P]
- Within Foundational: 14 tasks marked [P]
- **Within test sections**: Most test tasks marked [P] (can write multiple tests in parallel)
- User stories after Foundational: US3, US7 can run in parallel with any story
- US4, US8 can run in parallel after US1 completes
- Within each story: 2-5 entity/component tasks marked [P]
- **Within Approval Domain**: 7 entity tasks marked [P] (can create entities in parallel)

**Suggested MVP Scope**: Complete through Phase 5 (US2 Quotation) = ~138 tasks for first production-ready release (includes multi-level approval + FR-018c quotation revision notification + FR-062 Sales role customer assignment)

**Format Validation**: ✅ All tasks follow `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path` format
